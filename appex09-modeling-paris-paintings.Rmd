## Task 1

Fit a multiple linear regression model with the following main effects: `lrgfont`, `Height_in`, `Width_in`, and `relig`.

Interpret each of the estimated model coefficients.

## Task 2

Fit a multiple linear regression model with main effects for `Height_in` and `lrgfont`, as well as their interaction.

What is the model equation for paintings where the dealer devotes an additional paragraph? How about for paintings where the dealer does NOT devote an additional paragraph?
